# (Really) Simple Blog 

Mini-project to create a simple blog with PHP and Bash. It's effectively a static site generator but one which uses PHP to `include` the header and footer and some other important parts. This is just for my personal convenience. 


## Benefits

- Stupidly simple
- No database required 
- Edit with VIM and Markdown (and HTML)
- Basic CSS layout included
- SEO friendly
- Designed to be fast loading


## Usage

`sblog add` takes you through the process of writing a post

`sblog post` allows you to select which draft post you want to post


## Todo

- [x] Multiple instances (commands are designed to work from the root of the site you want to control)
- [ ] Better data for each post
