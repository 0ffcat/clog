# This Is An Example Post

This is an example of a post that can be created
with clog. The command to get to writing this was
`./clog add`, executed from the root of the
website in question.

The next thing to do is to publish the post, which
can be accomplished with `./clog publish`. 

The final step is done automatically, but can be
done manually with the command `./clog update`.
This updates the /index.html page in the website
root.
