<h1>This Is An Example Post</h1>

<p>This is an example of a post that can be created
with clog. The command to get to writing this was
<code>./clog add</code>, executed from the root of the
website in question.</p>

<p>The next thing to do is to publish the post, which
can be accomplished with <code>./clog publish</code>. </p>

<p>The final step is done automatically, but can be
done manually with the command <code>./clog update</code>.
This updates the /index.html page in the website
root. </p>
